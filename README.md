# Project Name

PROFsec (or currently named reprof) is a protein secondary structure and accessibility predictor from the Rost Lab. Prediction is either done from protein sequence alone or from an alignment - the latter should be used for optimal performance. The algorithm's implementation first started in Mar 24, 2011 and the language choosen was Perl.
